   <description>
      This mod provides a quick and dirty Japanese to English translation for the Ancient Species mod by Haduki and Heli, which adds "Weeb Half Elves" and "Weeb Ancient Elves" (their words, not mine) to the game.
      
      * It does *NOT* replace their mod, but uses the built-in translation features of RimWorld to add the translated strings. 
      * No other content is added, removed, or modified (the thumbnail is just for laughs).

      Therefore, this mod REQUIRES Ancient Species (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2154569778).

      [NOTES]
      * I am not Japanese, so the translations won't be precise.  English idioms, metaphors, and phrases will be worked into the text to attempt to convey the same meaning as the original, but I may be wrong in places.  Be patient, I am stupid.
      * Mods can break your game.  While I do the best I can, I am not liable if this mod causes something bad to happen to your save, game, computer, or sanity.
      * Downloading this mod from places other than Steam and our GitHub places you at risk of downloading bad things onto your computer.
      * The Ancient Species Mod is ©2020-2022 Haduki.  This mod's author is not associated with nor (currently) condoned by Haduki or their team.
      * The Ancient Species in English (AS/En) mod is ©2022 AS/En Contributors.  This content and it's source code is available to you under the MIT Open Source License. This means you can fork and re-upload without our permission, but you are required to give us credit somewhere when you do so.
      * Haduki is permitted to copy this translation into their mod, as long as credit is given.
