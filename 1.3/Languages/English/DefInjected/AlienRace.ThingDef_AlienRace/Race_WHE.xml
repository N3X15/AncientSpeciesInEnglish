  <AS_WHE_Race.description>Half-Elves are a race created using the technology of the Glitter World, combining the characteristics of humans and elves.\nLiving on a remote planet where they could not otherwise exist, these half-elves are thought to have been illegally traded among the Space Race and then crash-landed and settled on a remote planet.\nHalf elves are avid gunners, hunters, botanists, and cooks, not to mention their excellent survival skills, but they are closed off and quite mechanically deaf.</AS_WHE_Race.description>
